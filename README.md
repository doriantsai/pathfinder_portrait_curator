# pathfinder_portrait_curator
A script to curate my Pathfinder Kingmaker portrait collection.
Too many Pathfinder Kingmaker/Wrath of the Righteous portrait mods had inconsistent portrait sizes.
This script checks each portrait folder for the correct series of image sizes and filenames (as dictated by https://pathfinder-kingmaker.fandom.com/wiki/Custom_Portraits), and removes them automatically.
Handy when you have over a thousand portraits to sift through.
Hope this helps, cheers!
